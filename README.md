# Overview

This project was for learning the basics of Java. I know Java is an important language to know for embedded development and it is the basis of many popular applications and programs today. I know that Java/Kotlin are the basis for all Android applications. Knowing this, I wanted to create a simple program to learn the basics and become familiar with the language so that I could break into those fields. 

I wrote a basic program that helps you create a list of things you need to remember before you leave the house and where to find them. It provides the user with an empty list (a HashMap), and it allows the user to add items to the list, delete items from the list, view the list, and get the size of the list.

My purpose for writing this software was to learn the basics of the Java language and use my knowledge for something practical. I often forget things when I am leaving the house, so a program like this would benefit me.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

For this project, I used VS Code with some Java extensions. I also had to download the Java Development Kit and the Java compiler.

As stated before, this whole program is written in Java, and it imports all the extensions of the java.util library (java.util.*) to be able to use the HashMap and the Scanner objects.

# Future Work

* This program could incorporate some user input error checking
* A checklist could be added so that you can use the list as you are getting ready to leave
* A simple GUI could be added for usability
