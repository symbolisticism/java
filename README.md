# Overview

This project was for learning the basics of Java. I know Java is an important language to know for embedded development and it is the basis of many popular applications and programs today. I know that Java/Kotlin are the basis for all Android applications. Knowing this, I wanted to create a simple program to learn the basics and become familiar with the language so that I could break into those fields. 

{Provide a description the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Java language.}
I wrote a basic program that helps you create a list of things you need to remember before you leave the house and where to find them. 

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
